## Motivation

For many of us, much of our life is spent working. Basically, we revolve around our careers, and our careers shape our lives and growth. When I was organizing project processes recently, a thought struck me: What if we treated our career life like running a small company? Could we define some processes to guide and standardize our career activities? And each time we start a new job, it's like launching a new project for ourselves. Projects have beginnings and endings, they bring gains but also some challenges, much like the different phases we experience in our careers.

## Purpose

KIMS is mainly about making my career activities more organized and structured. It's like treating myself as a small team or a small company, managing each career step like a project. This helps me showcase my abilities and learn new skills. The goal is to always be in a better position when I switch jobs and create win-win partnerships.
