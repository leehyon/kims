**KIMS** stands for **K**oh **I**ntegrated **M**anagement **S**ystem. Let's call it my "Personal Information and Quality Management System" for now. This system mainly brings together various aspects of my professional life and aims to provide a consistent and organized way to manage my career activities.

## Motivation

For many of us, much of our life is spent working. Basically, we revolve around our careers, and our careers shape our lives and growth. When I was organizing project processes recently, a thought struck me: What if we treated our career life like running a small company? Could we define some processes to guide and standardize our career activities? And each time we start a new job, it's like launching a new project for ourselves. Projects have beginnings and endings, they bring gains but also some challenges, much like the different phases we experience in our careers.

## Purpose

KIMS is mainly about making my career activities more organized and structured. It's like treating myself as a small team or a small company, managing each career step like a project. This helps to showcase my abilities and learn new skills. The goal is to always be in a better position when I switch jobs and create win-win partnerships.

## Framework

The KIMS framework mainly includes the following:

- **Areas and Contribution**: Based on accumulated knowledge, identifying the areas and goals for future development and the contributions that can be made for your employer.
- **System Requirements**: Ensuring that professional projects meet the required process standards and system requirements, similar to the A-SPICE development model[^1].
- **Strategy and Measurements**: Reflected in measurable metrics at different levels, these metrics can be understood as the data support needed to implement strategies and make decisions.
- **Processes and Functions**: Project processes and functional components, which can be thought of as the methodology for how work is done but in a more specific manner.
- **Manuals and Help**: Project manuals, development guides, and other documentation.

[^1]: This is only for analogy. It needs to be customized based on individual needs, but it may also reference some mainstream models.

Currently, there's just a rough framework, and the upcoming details might be adjusted. But first, we need to change our mindset from simply working to collaborating, from just going to work to providing value. Then, based on all these activities, we could start focusing on project-level process management and quality assurance.
