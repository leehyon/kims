## Learned from Lego

Sometimes I think career development is like building Lego bricks. Through college education we collect some scattered small bricks, then from the first job, we assemble those bricks into some meaningful parts, contributing to the building of a larger set, and accumulating more bricks in the process. And with every job change, we hope to reuse modules we've assembled before, or make small tweaks, contributing to other sets. 

This way, little by little, slowly, we accumulate more reusable modules and rare bricks that can coordinate with other sets. And some excellent people can even build a complete work just with their own bricks, without needing to participate in other sets. Of course, there are also some other people, who don't have enough bricks or modules to join, their career path may not be so smooth.
